# Harpinder Jot Singh

I am Harpinder, working at [DevRev](https://devrev.ai/) almost since the start of the company. I have experience in building products 0->1, am a generalist by nature, and have worked on multiple projects here at DevRev including the [Snap-in platform](https://docs.devrev.ai/snapins), and ML/LLMOps solution for our AI needs.

I did my B.tech in Computer Science from BITS Pilani.

Recently, I have started diving into LLMs era, and tinker around with them in my free time.
